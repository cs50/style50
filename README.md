# style50
This is style50, a tool with which code can be checked against the CS50 style guide.

## Installation

    pip install style50

In order to style check C, C++, or Java code, a recent version (`>=3.0`) of `astyle` must be installed. `astlye` may be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/astyle/astyle%203.0.1/).

## Usage

```
usage: style50 [-h] [-o MODE] [-v] [files [files ...]]

positional arguments:
  files                 files/directories to lint

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o MODE, --output MODE
                        specify output mode
  -v, --verbose         print full tracebacks of errors
```

`style50` takes zero or more files/directories to style check. If no arguments are given, `style50` will recursively check the current directory. 

`MODE` can be one of `side_by_side` (default), `unified`, `raw`, and `json`. `side_by_side` and `unified` output side-by-side and unified diffs between the inputted file and the correctly styled version respectively. `raw` outputs the raw percentage of correct (unchanged) lines, while `json` outputs a json object containing information pertinent to the CS50 IDE plugin (coming soon).

## Language Support
`style50` currently supports the following languages:
    * C
    * C++
    * Python
    * Javascript
    * Java

### Adding a new language

Adding a new language is very simple. Language checks are encoded as classes which inherit from the `StyleCheck` base class (see `style50/checks.py` for more real-world examples). The following is a template for style checks which allows style50 to check the imaginary FooBar language for style.

```python
import re

from style50 import StyleCheck, Style50

class FooBar(StyleCheck):
    
    # REQUIRED: this property informs style50 what file extensions this 
    # check should be run on (in this case, all .fb and .foobar files)
    extensions = ["fb", "foobar"]

    # REQUIRED: should return a correctly styled version of `code`
    def style(self, code):
        # All FooBar code is perfectly styled
        return code

    # OPTIONAL: should return the number of comments in `code`. 
    # If this function is not defined, `style50` will not warn the student about 
    # too few comments
    def count_comments(self, code):
        # A real-world, check would need to worry about not counting '#' in string-literals
        return len(re.findall(r"#.*", code))
```

All classes which inherit from `StyleCheck` are automatically registered with `style50`'s `Style50` class, making style50 easily extensible. Adding the following to the above code creates a script which checks the code that `style50` already does as well as FooBar programs.

```python
# Style check the current directory, printing a unified diff
Style50(["."], output="unified").run()

```
